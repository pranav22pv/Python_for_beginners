# Use comments to write why's and how's , and not what's
# Unnecessary comments are distracting
# Comments can be used to add notes to a blovk of code , or remind yourself the next time u visit the code or simply
# leave notes for other developers to understand your code..

# Do not add comments before block of codes that are obvious. like

# Calculates square of a number
def square(number)
    return number*number

    # It already is obvious that the function is goin to return the square of a number.
