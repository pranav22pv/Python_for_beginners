# tuples are like list , can store items , but unlike lists , they are inserted btw paranthesis ()
# items in tuples cannot be modified like in lists
# we only have two methods..  count and index , we can only get information abt the tuple but cannot change anything

numbers = (1,2,3)
print(numbers)
print(numbers[0])
# numbers[0] = 1    # if u try to run this, u will get error bcoz values in a tuple can't be modified

# most of the times we use lists.. to make sure no where in the program we accidentally modify the list , we can use tuples
